## JS QuickSearch

**JS QuickSearch** is a web application for quickly searching and getting reference information about JavaScript methods and functions.

### How to Run the Application

Follow these steps to get the application up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   First, clone the project to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexDjs/JS-QuickSearc.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   Use the terminal or file explorer to go to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd JS-QuickSearch
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` File**
   You can open the project in your browser in two ways:
   
   - **Option 1**: Simply double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default browser.
   - **Option 2**: If you want to run a local development server (which may be useful for testing), you can use a tool like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in Visual Studio Code, or use any other local server.

4. **Run the Application**
   - Once the `index.html` is open in your browser, you can start typing in the search box to begin using the application.

### Additional Notes
- The app doesn't require any additional dependencies or installation steps.
- If you want to extend or modify the data (JavaScript methods and examples), you can easily edit the `javascriptReference.js` file.
